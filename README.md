a logistic regression project to predict customer churn for a telecom company, optimizing the model using Lasso Regression and providing key insights for targeted marketing and improved customer retention


## Introduction
This project aims to develop a logistic regression model to accurately predict customer churn for a Californian Telecommunications company. By analyzing customer data, the project seeks to identify key factors influencing churn rates and assist the company in strategic decision-making to enhance customer retention.

## Data Description
The analysis was conducted using a dataset comprising various customer attributes including demographics, subscription plans, service usage, and more. 

## Methodology
Our approach involved rigorous data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and multicollinearity examination. We employed Lasso Regression and Stepwise Regression for effective variable selection, followed by logistic regression model fitting.

## Results
The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting customer churn. Key insights were gained regarding the impact of various customer attributes on churn likelihood, which are vital for informed marketing strategies.
